An easy way to add mobile responsive videos to your posts, pages, widgets, and other content areas.


== Description ==

It's never been easier to include responsive Youtube and Vimeo videos on your website. From a simple, intuitive interface you can insert a video right into your posts, pages, and widget areas within seconds. Include a description of the video, customise the look and feel, comes with multiple sizes to choose from that are fully customisable, and several video alignments are available.

A shortcode is generated and is used to create the content. Included in the plugin are shortcode generators so you can create one without worrying about how to write a shortcode manually.

Full supporting information is built right into the plugin with a bespoke plugin settings page. Shortcode information fully documented.
